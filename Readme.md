Quick Javascript project build to test the Pokemon API.

Aimed to be a good first project or those looking to try out something with Restful API's.

Create 3 files
pokemon.html, pokemon.js, and styles.css

Add the code.
You can checkout my code and build on it if you like.

The basic pokemon that you can put in the box are listed here:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

The search has to all be in lower case.

Full doco for the Pokemon API is listed here:
https://pokeapi.co

Future Ideas:
Take pokemon name and accept all case, convert to lowercase on input.
Change formatting
Display the character skills such as damage etc.
Random
Berries button
Pokedex

#Inspired by another Pokemon project I found online for Hacktoberfest
