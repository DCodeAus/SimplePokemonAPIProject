### Quick Javascript project build to test the Pokemon API.

Aimed to be a good first project or those looking to try out something with Restful API's.

Create 3 files

- pokemon.html,
- pokemon.js,
- and styles.css

Add the code from the three files.

You can checkout my code and build on it if you like, or else copy paste into your own program.

The basic pokemon that you can put in the box are listed in the documentation here:
https://pokeapi.co

One caveat is that, the search has to all be in lower case. And the pokemon has to be spelled correctly. Test your search out here:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

Full doco for the Pokemon API is listed here:
https://pokeapi.co

Future Ideas:
Take pokemon name and accept all case, convert to lowercase on input/submit.
Change formatting of the page so that its more dynamic/CSS style.
Display:

- the character skills such as damage etc.
- Random pokemon
- Add Berries button
- Maybe a Pokedex lookup

#Inspired by another Pokemon project found online for Hacktoberfest, this is barebones and would be a great starter project.
